# Active China Front-End Engineer Hiring Process

日期：2017-10-24

## Phone screen inteview

Bascially, it'd last **20-30m** around. I don't have a formal process for it, but for now I'd like to share my experiences.

I usually start off asking the candidate about their background, how they came to work with Front-End related engineering, what they did at their last job/project, and various other general questions.
We will at some point begin to ask technical questions - such as various things about HTML/CSS, flexboxes, responsive web design techniques, and separately for JavaScript.
I poke a little to see if the candidate understands certain concepts like Closures, event live binding/bubbling, Promises, MV* Frameworks, Data Models, AJAX/Fetch, Prototype Chain or Lexical Scope, etc.
Best is if the candidate has public sites that they've worked on or public Github urls, and we can take a look at the site, viewing the source code, and have the candidate talk us through their work.

## Face-to-face interview

- Prefer to have 3 FEEs in addition to Manager participate in the interview

    It's important for us to get an option from multiple people

- Technical interview around **2h**

    We have some general Evaluation Points in terms of technical interview.

    - Is the candidate excellent at HTML + CSS?
    - Is the candidate excellent at JavaScript? What level?
    - Is the candidate familiar with advanced client-side frameworks? How familiar?
    - Is the candidate familiar with mobile (including responsive, adaptive, and more)? How familiar?
    - Is the candidate familiar with frontend performance? How familiar?
    - ...

## Gathering information

And next what we'll be doing is gathering information.

  - Does the candidate have an advanced level of knowledge?
  - Is it more middle-level?
  - Is the candidate stuck in certain ways, or is the candidate eager to learn?
  - If the candidate is advanced, will the candidate be willing to work in our existing code and help to improve it, or is the candidate only happy if they work in the latest technologies?

I think you all should get the idea after the technical group interview.

## Compare notes and discuss the interview then make the decision

At the end of the interview, interviewers should have a 10-15m group meeting to discuss the proces of the interivew, and how you do feel about the candidate, just speak out with your first impression. Next you must be prepared to make a decision about the candidate. We only have two possible options: **Hire** or **No Hire**. No other possible answer.

## Important Notes

>If anyone says **no** the candidate, then we just pass on the candidate.

>The most important priciple is that we're looking for people who are **smart enough** and **get things done**. Remember it through the whole interview process.
